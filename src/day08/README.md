# Merge Linked Lists

- Take two linked lists and zip them together (merge while alternating nodes from each list)

## Challenge

- Write a function that accepts two linked lists as parameters, merges them into a new list and returns it. 
- The lists have to be "zipped" together meaning that each node that's appended will alternate between list 1 and list 2.

## Credit

- Worked with Tara Johnson & Molly Kent to solve this problem
