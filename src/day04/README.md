Find the highest value of adjacent integers within a 2D array. These values can be left, right, above, below, and diagonal to each other.

## Challenge

- Create a double for loop to iterate through two dimensional array.
- Compare the current index's value against it's adjacent neighbors.
- Return the value that is the highest.
