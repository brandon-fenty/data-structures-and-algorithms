# Reverse a linked list

- Given a linked list, reverse the order

## Challenge

- Create a function that accepts a linked list as a parameter and reverses the order without using built in methods or function.
- Do this while maintaining an O(1) for space (Do not create a new list, switch the reference points of the original)

## Credits

- Worked with Tara Johnson to solve this problem
